# Random Number Sequence Discriminator

## Overview
This work deals with discriminating patterns created using random numbers generated from different functions. For example, the figures show a 2D histogram created using random numbers from a Gaussian distribution (left) and a 2D histogram created using Gaussian and Landau distributions where the random numbers generated from the former is the x-coordinate and the latter is the y-coordinate (right).

Although the difference between both figures is clear when there is 5 million entries in the figure, it is not clearly distinguishable when there is say, only 30, entries i.e 30 pairs of random numbers. For example, the below figures are 2D histogram created using random numbers from a Gaussian distribution (left) and a 2D histogram created using Gaussian and Landau distributions where the random numbers generated from the former is the x-coordinate and the latter is the y-coordinate (right).
