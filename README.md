# Random Number Sequence Discriminator

## Overview
This work deals with discriminating patterns created using random numbers generated from different functions. For example, the figures show a 2D histogram created using random numbers from a Gaussian distribution (left) and a 2D histogram created using Gaussian and Landau distributions where the random numbers generated from the former is the x-coordinate and the latter is the y-coordinate.
